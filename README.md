# TRiG
Redrecting the implementation of CVPR2022 paper: Transform-Retrieve-Generate: Natural Language-Centric Outside-Knowledge Visual Question Answering **[web](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Gao_Transform-Retrieve-Generate_Natural_Language-Centric_Outside-Knowledge_Visual_Question_Answering_CVPR_2022_paper.html)**
.

## Link to TRiG implementation
Thanks to my fellow @Weizhe Lin, an unofficial implementation of TRiG can be found here:
<https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/Retrieval-Augmented-Visual-Question-Answering?tab=readme-ov-file#trig>.

I (the first author) certify that this implementation achieves very similar performances of TRiG, following the same method from the official manuscript: **[pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Gao_Transform-Retrieve-Generate_Natural_Language-Centric_Outside-Knowledge_Visual_Question_Answering_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)**

You are also welcomed to implement TRiG by yourself as it is straightforward to understand.

## DisClaimer
Due to the policies of Amazon, the official implementation of TRiG is not permitted to release (2023/12). Fortunately, you can find the 3rd party implementation from above link for your convenience. Note that, Amazon has not supported or certified the above implementation.
